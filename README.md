## The ultimate introduction to Pygame

**Diary**

Not finding job as frontend developer, I decided to take a break by learning and playing with Python. I was already planning to gain some backend knowledge, though my initial choices were either NodeJs or PHP. But, I wanted to create 'Flappy Bird' game, and so I decided on Python. Also I was somewhat facinated by it and it looked to me kinda mysterious. So this is my first project with 'Pygame', I already watched basic tutorial on Python, to get to know basics of syntax and rules.
